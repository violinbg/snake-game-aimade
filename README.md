# Please Note

**This project is generated with CoPilot + ChatGPT-4.1. I made this by testing the Agent in VSCode and was just prompting - "vibe coding" ðŸ¤”. The assets for this game are also generated via AI - using Microsoft Copilot and then lightly edited with Paint.NET.**

I've recoded a YouTube video documenting this: [AI-Powered Vibe Coding: Snake Game in VSCode Agent Mode!](https://youtu.be/LzOPH2rAWWY)

PS: I'm not claming to be good at making videos nor that this project is anything impressive or useful. It was just a few hours of fun after work, which I decided to document.

# TestAI 2D Game Project

This is a Go project using the [Ebiten](https://ebiten.org/) library for 2D game development.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have Go installed: https://golang.org/dl/

- Ebiten is already included as a dependency.
- To run the project:
  ```cmd
  go run main.go
  ```

## Project Structure
- `main.go`: Entry point and basic Ebiten game loop.

## Next Steps
- Add your game logic to the `Update` method in `main.go`.
- Draw graphics in the `Draw` method.
- Adjust the window size in the `Layout` method.

For more, see the [Ebiten documentation](https://ebiten.org/documents/overview.html).
